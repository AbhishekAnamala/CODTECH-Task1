This an user authentication task which has the below functionalities:
bcrypt: Passwords are hashed before being stored using bcrypt’s hash function.
•	Session: After a successful login, a session is created that stores the user’s email, allowing them to stay logged in across requests.
•	Routing: /register, /login, and /logout routes handle the authentication process.
•	Frontend: Forms in index.html allow users to register and log in, while the scripts handle form submissions and communicate with the backend API.
•	Store users in a database (like MongoDB or MySQL) instead of a dummy in-memory array.
•	Use https and set secure cookies (cookie: { secure: true } in the session config).
•	Add error handling, validations, and password strength requirements.
